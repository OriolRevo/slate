# Xef Webhooks

## Introduction


Revo Xef comes with [webhooks](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook). You can add as many as you need in the `webhooks` page [https://revoxef.works/account/webhooks](https://revoxef.works/account/webhooks)

Once you create your first webhook a secret key will be generated and this will be used to create a hash that we will send in every webhook call so you can verify it is us who send it.

We will send the header.  

`X-Revo-Hmac-SHA256`

With the body hashed with the `SHA256` algorithm and using the `secret key` generated when creating the first webhook.

The payload will always have the keys

```sh
{
    "event" : "order.closed",
    "data" : {
        "id" : 298
        "table_id" : 12 
        "guests" : 4
    }
}
```
